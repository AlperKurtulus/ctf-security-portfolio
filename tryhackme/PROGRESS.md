## 📝 Internal Box

**Completed:** November 9, 2025  
**Difficulty:** Hard ⭐⭐⭐  
**Time:** 4.5 hours  

### Attack Chain:Nmap → Gobuster → WordPress → WPScan → Theme Editor RCE ↓ www-data shell → /opt/wp-save.txt → aubreanna user ↓ jenkins.txt → SSH Tunnel → Internal Jenkins → Hydra ↓ admin:spongebob → Script Console → jenkins container ↓ /opt/note.txt → root credentials → ROOT

### Key Techniques:
- WordPress theme editor exploitation (RCE)
- Manual credential hunting with pattern-based searching
- SSH local port forwarding to internal services
- Hydra web form brute force
- Jenkins Script Console exploitation (Groovy)
- Docker container enumeration
- Multi-layered privilege escalation (6 stages)

### Lessons Learned:
- LinPEAS doesn't catch everything - manual enumeration is critical
- Pattern-based file searching reveals hidden credentials
- SSH tunneling is essential for accessing internal services
- Multi-layered defenses can all fail if each layer has weaknesses
